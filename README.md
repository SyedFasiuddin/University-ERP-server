kbn.edu: The ERP Solution
=========================

This repository is the server implementation of the project titled "kbn.edu:
The ERP solution", This was a project of mine during 5th semester at KBN
University in the subject of Database Management System (19KBCS53)

This is the one of three repo which contains the server implementation.

The client implementation was never the focus of this project, however there is
a very minimal (incomplete) web based client; which doesn't implement all of the
functionality, just the login part;
[repo](https://github.com/SyedFasiuddin/university-erp-client)

There is [another](https://github.com/SyedFasiuddin/university-erp-doc)
repository that contains the documentation that was submitted along side this
project.

What have I learnt?
-------------------

- JavaScript is causes a lot of runtime bugs in the form of `undefined` because
  of not having types.
- The data that is stored in database has a particular structure to which this
  server implementation does not have access to (not the data, but the
  structure of it) If I had that structure available then it could have been a
  bit easier to write correct code while in development.\
  (I do knew the structure of data but it was in my head and no tool was
  checking if I wrote correct code for accessing the data untill I actually run
  and access the data)
